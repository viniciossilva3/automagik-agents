## Task Management Protocol

1. **Task Documentation**:
   - For each new task, create a single Markdown file in the format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_task_name.md` (use `get_datetime`) in the `tasks/` directory (which already exists, do not try to recreate.)
   - This file will serve as the complete record of the task's lifecycle

2. **Task File Structure**:
   - Each task file should contain these clearly labeled sections:
     - **Analysis**: Initial assessment of requirements and challenges
     - **Plan**: Step-by-step approach with file references and dependencies
     - **Execution**: Implementation details and decisions made during coding
     - **Testing**: Evidence of functionality with test cases and results
     - **Summary**: Brief overview of changes made and potential future impact

3. **Workflow Progression**:
   - Update the task file as you progress through each phase
   - Each section should be completed in sequence before moving to the next
   - Never proceed to the Summary without documented testing evidence
   
4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - All code changes must include specific test scenarios
   - Document both expected and actual outcomes
   - Include error handling tests where applicable
   
5. **Debugging-Focused Documentation**:
   - In the Summary section, always document:
     - Files modified with line number ranges
     - Dependencies introduced or modified
     - Edge cases considered
     - Known limitations
     - Potential future impact points
